##Motivations

After applying for a junior developer position at Natural Habitat Adventures I took it upon myself to build the organization's landing page from scratch. 

As a recent graduate of Turing School I keep hearing I don't have enough experience. This project demonstrates my skill as well as my enthusiasm and determination to succeed as a developer.

## Features/Wins/Struggles

The carousel of Featured Trips & Destinations presented the biggest challenge. I wanted to write the code from scratch and not use a prebuilt component. Though successful, the code is a verbose and I believe could be refactored into a switch statement for readability. 

## Code Example

For the Regional Trips section, I wanted it to by dynamic. So I created a component to contain the individual trips, then made each regional trip its own component populated from a separate data file. The data file is straight forward and makes updating the site incredibly efficient. Simple code written with usability in mind.

Example of the regional trips compenent which maps over the data file to populate the cards:

The data set from which the regional trip cards are populated from:
